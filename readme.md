# gdx-gamesvcs-app

(THIS VERSION FOR ME DOES NOT SEEM TO FEED THE "CLIENT_ID" TO THE "DESKTOP" BUILD.  I HAVE STRIPPED DOWN THE PROJECT TO THE ANDROID AND DESKTOP VERSIONS ONLY WHILE ALSO UPDATING THE GRADLE VERSION TO 4.10.2.  I CAN PRODUCE NEW OAUTH 2 CREDENTIALS, SO PUTTING A WORKING CLIENT_ID AND SECRET IN THIS REPOSITORY DOES NOT BOTHER ME.)

(A "local.properties" FILE WILL NEED TO BE ADDED TO THE PROJECT FOR THE ANDROID PART TO COMPILE.  ALSO AS A REMINDER, THE RUN CONFIGURATION IN INTELLIJ FOR THE "DesktopLauncher" WILL NEED TO BE SET TO THE "../ANDROID/ASSETS/" FOLDER.)

THANK YOU.
