# gdx-gamesvcs-app

(THIS "FORK" UPDATES THE CODE WITH GRADLE 5.1.1.  ALSO, ONLY ANDROID AND DESKTOP ARE REPRESENTED.  THE FILE "gpgs-client_secret.json" HAS BEEN UPDATED FOR A BIT MORE CLARITY.)

(A "local.properties" FILE WILL NEED ADDING TO THE PROJECT FOR THE ANDROID PART TO COMPILE.  AS USUAL, "DesktopLauncher" WILL NEED "../ANDROID/ASSETS" OR SIMILAR SET IN THE RUN CONFIGURATION OF INTELLIJ.)
